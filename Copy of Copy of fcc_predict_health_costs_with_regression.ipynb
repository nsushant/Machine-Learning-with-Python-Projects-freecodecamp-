Use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.\n","\n","The first two cells of this notebook import libraries and the data.\n","\n","Make sure to convert categorical data to numbers. Use 80% of the data as the `train_dataset` and 20% of the data as the `test_dataset`.\n","\n","`pop` off the \"expenses\" column from these datasets to create new datasets called `train_labels` and `test_labels`. Use these labels when training your model.\n","\n","Create a model and train it with the `train_dataset`. Run the final cell in this notebook to check your model. The final cell will use the unseen `test_dataset` to check how well the model generalizes.\n","\n","To pass the challenge, `model.evaluate` must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.\n","\n","The final cell will also predict expenses using the `test_dataset` and graph the results."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1rRo8oNqZ-Rj"},"source":["# Import libraries.
